#500 Basic Hebrew Words

The original deck is from [TeachMeHebrew.com](http://www.teachmehebrew.com/) which you can find [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3696327833). It uses the format "Front card: word spoken in Hebrew. Back: word written in Hebrew, translation in English, and transliteration". 

I'm neither into transliteration because I can read Hebrew, nor into translation since I'd much rather link Hebrew words to something not language specific. What I've been doing is (I think I'll either look for already made resources or automate this task):


* Listen to the word.
* Look it up on Google images.
* If it's a clearly defined thing like fruit/object, I'll have most images about the same thing. I'll pick one and add it to the deck.
* If it's a concept, I'll try to get an image that conveys it. If I can't find any, I'll make mine. Like this:

  The first card serves for both words (אבל, which means "but/however" and אולי, which means "maybe".. "But maybe..") The second card is tied to the word איפה (where) and the big guy says "Where's the money?". He's a former Finance Minister as I mentioned in the NB.
