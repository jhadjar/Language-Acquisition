#Hebrew - עברית

## Alphabet:

There's no substitute for knowing the alphabet to be able to read. It doesn't matter if you understand the words, but the ability to read is important. It eliminates the fear most people, especially those who only know the latin alphabet, have. A few reasons to learn the alphabet as soon as possible:

* It gives confidence. 
* Takes the foreign out of a "foreign language". 
* Makes us able to "aproxiguess" words we hear and look them up.
* Makes subsequent efforts easier (doing Duolingo lessons with Hebrew script), using Hebrew dictionaries.

* There are only 22 letters: אבגדהוזחטיכךלמםנןסעפףצץקרשת
* Here's a great [Anki deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/504358078) with audio from TeachMeHebrew.com.
* Five of them are written differently when they're at the end of a word.
* Written from right to left (just like Arabic).
