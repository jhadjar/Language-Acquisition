A few things you can notice:

* There are only 22 letters.
* Five of them are written differently when they're at the end of a word (מם נן כך צץ פף).
* If you know Arabic, it looks insanely close. Example: in Arabic, "Arabic" and "Hebrew" are عربية عبرية. In Hebrew, they're  ערבית עברית. There are also numerous words written and pronounced the same (דמ دم), (סכין سكين), etc.
* Here's a great [Anki deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/504358078) with audio from TeachMeHebrew.com.
* Written from right to left (just like Arabic).
