# Language-Acquisition

## What & Why
Repo to test tracking language acquisition efforts using GitHub. It might be useful to start and maintain a habit, etc.

## Languages:

* [Russian](https://github.com/jhadjar/Language-Acquisition/tree/master/Russian)

* [Hebrew](https://github.com/jhadjar/Language-Acquisition/tree/master/Hebrew) (as an Arabic speaker, there's an advantage to learn that language)

Spanish: I'm done with Duo's Spanish tree. As a French speaker, comprehension is pretty good pero no puedo articular ideas.

German: Not yet done with Duo.
